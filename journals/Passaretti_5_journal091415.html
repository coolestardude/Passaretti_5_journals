<h1>Div Journal</h1>
<p>The webpage is a colorfuly-made page, with its stuff aligned in the center of the page. It also links to other pages linked to the same CSS</p>
<br>
<p>nav, header, and aside created colored lines to divide/sort the page</p>
<br>
<p>a:hover changes the text when you mouse over it</p>
<br>
<p>Since all of these pretty much do the same thing, we can move fast through them</p>
